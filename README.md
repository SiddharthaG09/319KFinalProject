# 319KFinalProject

For our final project, we recreated Space Invaders in C, using a custom-designed PCB and an MSPM0G3507 microcontroller. The game integrates hardware components including buttons, a slide potentiometer, and a DAC to control gameplay elements. We designed, printed, and assembled the PCB ourselves, and developed the game logic and graphics from scratch to run on the microcontroller.
